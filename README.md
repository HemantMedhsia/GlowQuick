```javascript
// Example usage
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.jsx';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

# Named Codeblocks

## Usage

When outputting files, always put them inside of fenced code blocks with  backticks that indicate both extension and path, e.g.

`````js path="index.js"
console.log("hello,world!");
// A comment with backticks preventing from using  or  backticks: ````
`````

Use tildes (`~~~~~`) instead of backticks for fenced code blocks when dealing with backtick-heavy content.

When the user requests binary files you can insert them by passing a URL as content of a named codeblock (NB: one url per file!)
```
